# INTRODUCTION

SMARA Cancer Support Group is a site that provides an basic overview of the cancer support group's services.  Currently the site operates from a Facebook page (with a limited Instragram profile in addition), and this site is intended to help increase the groups visibility to potential users.  The site is aimed at people searching for cancer support services in South Trinidad, and will allow them to see what supports and activites the group offers to them, providing links to the groups active social media pages, and providing a method for people to get in touch with the group to engage with its services. As the groups resources grow it is envisaged that the site can be expanded to include more detailed information on the groups activities., such as fundraising activities, upcoming events, and provide an online method to contribute donations to help fund the group's activities.


# USER EXPERIENCES

## User Stories

Shanna - newly diagnosed with cancer, doesn't understand the treatment pathway (feature of importance: patient navigation)

Ravi - referred for cancer treatment, however doesn't have money to pay for a taxi to get to treatment sessions (feature of importance: financial assistance)

Kaloutie - finished cancer treatment, feeling unsure of what's next and how to cope without regular contact with medical professionals (feature of importance: counselling)

---

# DESIGN

## Colour scheme
The colour scheme is sased on the Trinidad flag colours - red, white and black (with the use of grey as a feature).  This was chosen to give the site a local feel that would be familiar to its users and help inspire trust.

## Typograhy <!--what fonts and why?-->  
Open Sans was selected as the primary font for headings as it is clear and easily legible - this is aided by its sans serif type.  It is important for this site to have an easily readable font as many of its user base may have trouble with literacy and it was important to avoid the font used making understanding the text difficult to understand. Montserrat was chosen as the body text as this is also a clear and easily readable font, which pairs well with Open Sans (for cohesiveness) (as reccomended by www.figma.com/google-fonts/open-sans-font-pairings/), with a seconadary default text of Arial - as this is a commonly available font which is also very legible.

# FEATURES
<!-- (In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things). 

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:-->

## 1. Header and Navigation Bar

The site name, cancer ribbon, and navigation bar are present and consistent at the top of all four site pages.

The cancer ribbon next to the group name quickly and easily identifies the page as relating to cancer, re-inforcing the reason the user visits the page.

The group name is simple and clear, making it easy for the user to identify the overall purpose of the site when on each page

The navigation menu provides links to each of the four site pages, it clearly indicates which page the user is currently on, and allows the user to easily navigate around the site at all times without having to leave the page space

## 2. Hero Image

The hero image was selected as this shows a number of hands reaching for assistance, indicating the site's purpose (to provide assistance and support), incorporating the colours selected for the site design (increasing familiarity and trust in the site), along with the hands reflecting the multi-cultural potential user base of the group.  

The text overlay on the hero image lets the user know what the basic aims of the group are and defines the catchment area for the group's users.

## 3. Services Section

This section breaks down the basic services of the group into three categories (Patient Navigation, Financial Assistance, Counselling), explaining in simple terms what each function of the group is for and how it each could benefit the visitor.

## 4. Footer

The footer is present at the bottom of each of the four site pages.  It has icon-based links for the two social media sites that are active for the group, so that the user is aware of what social media sites are active for the group (and they can visit these and follow the sites to stay connected or get up-to-date information on group events etc), and also a link to the medical centre where the group's services are based, so the user can see the group is aligned to an established medical facility (helping to engender trust in the site).

## 5. About Page

The about page is split into two sections:
    
a.  Who are we
 This section explains who set up the group, and who is involved in running it.  This helps the user to understand that the group is run by local people (engendering trust) and also shows that both lay people and professionals help to run it (demonstrating that the user can find both peer and professional support from the group).  A picture of some of the group volunteers <!--imaginary group members??-->, photographed in the medical facility lobby, is included, as this helps the user to visualise the group members, and understand that they appear both local (i.e. not an international organisation) and approachable looking.

b. Who we serve
This section clearly explains the catchment area for the groups users.  It defines where the group is based (i.e. a local medical facility), giving the group credibility.  It also offers advice to page visitors who reside outside of the catchment area on alternate places to seek assistance, meaning the page is of use to a visitor even if they do not fall into the relevant catchment area. A hyperlink is included to the reccomended alterante site, to assit the user to find the help they need without having to leave the site. A hyperlink is added to the medical facility mentioned within the text to allow the user to visit the centres website, opening in a new page, meaning the user does not have to leave the site to find out more about the medical centre.  A map is included in this section, showing the location of the SMARA offices (at the medical centre), allowing the user to easily visualise where on-site services are based. 
      
## 6. Resources Page
       
The resources page has two sections:

a. Video
A short video explaining what patient navigation is is embedded on first section of this page.  This allows the user to quickly explore the value of patient navigation services, as this concept is often not well understood by new patients.

b. Links to useful resources
The second section provides a number of links to useful resources, along with a written description of why each link is considered useful.  This will aid the user by providing trusted sources for further cancer information, and also helps to establish the trustworthiness of the site (as the resources referenced are all from national or internationally recognised sites).

## 7. Contact Page
	
The contact page has two sections:
    
a. Request Contact section
This section contains a form the user can fill out to request a member of the group contact them for further information.  The inclusion of the last name is optional, which is of benefit to the user as they may not feel confident on first contact to provide their full name (increasing trust in the group and the site).  The user can enter either email or a phone number as they prefer - this gives the user the confidence to select the contact method they feel most comfortable with. The phone number section is limited to 16 characters, to minimise entry of an incorrect number, whilst also allowing for data entry in the full international dialing code format.  Radio button options at the end of the form allow the user to indicate which service they may be interested in exploring, which will help the group member making contact to be well prepared for the first contact encounter with the user and to help make the ensuing contact more relevant.
    
b. Contact Us section
This section provides the user with a contact name, email and phone number for the group.  This provides transparency for the user, and allows the user to make contact directly if they feel more comfortable with this.  A map is also included showing the location of the group's main office (at the medical clinic), allowing the user to know where the group is located.

## Future Features

1. Donate button - addition of a donate feature to help increase group funds

2. Addition of an Up to date events page - currently events are communicated to users via the group's facebook page.  If the static site is successful, the addition of a page that would show both past and upcoming events would benefit the user as they could see how they could become involved in the group's activities without directly accessing the primary services (as detailed on the landing page).  It would also benefit the group as it would increase the visibility of upcoming events, and encourage visitors to donate towards events they are interested in.

3. Information page for volunteers
