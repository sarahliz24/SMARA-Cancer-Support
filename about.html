            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>SMARA was founded by Patricia Tikasingh, in 2004.<br>As a cancer survior herself, Pat experienced first-hand the need for greater support for patients experiencing a cancer diagnosis 
                and treatment, and also for those surviving or needing end-of-life care.<br>Now working with team of up to 60 volunteers (including members of the local community, survivors, care
                professionals and local business people), SMARA is here to support the people of South Trinidad during their cancer journey.<br>Services are based in Southern Medical Clinic
                (see our link in the footer), where Pat also works as a patient cousellor and co-ordinator, however we can assist people who are being treated in any centre.
                <br>We are a not-for-profit organisation.  All of our services 
                are provided free of charge.<br>We are local, and we are here for you!</p>
